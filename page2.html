<header>Bears!</header>

<p>
    Everyone knows you shouldn't mess with bears.
    What everyone doesn't know is that bears are actually great construction workers!
    Across the whole globe, bears populate a total of two different states: Oregon and California.
    Most of the time, they get up to bear-esque activities, such as hunting for food, etc.
    However, whenever no one's looking, the bear will retrieve their box of power tools, and build mysterious, empty wooden cabins deep in the woods.
    Reports on human television have described the mysterious appearances of these wooden cabins, and some brave humans have even decided to live in them.
    To this day, though, no human has ever discovered the truth behind these bustling bears.

<p> Giraffes have an extremely large appetite. 
    Luckily, they're great at finding food. 
    In fact, Giraffes spend an average of 1,564 hours foraging every day! 
    Giraffes search the globe far and wide for food, even finding food in places that would usually be very difficult, such as barren wastelands. 
    Giraffes will gobble up food on sight until they're fully satiated. 
    Then, they'll continue to hunt for food so they may collect a surplus. 
    Once the giraffes have gathered a large surplus, they coalesce, and place their food in one massive pile. 
    The giraffes will then gather in the colosseum and engage in fierce combat. 
    Afterwards, the giraffes will make up with each other, thank each other for the fight, and the victor may wear food on his or her head as a hat.</p>

    <header>Lions!</header>

<p>
    Lions LOVE hugs.
    Whenever a lion is feeling particularly lonely, he or she will summon his or her special lion antennae and broadcast a radio signal that alerts other lions to his or her loneliness.
    Then, the closest lion will run over full-sprint and hug the lonely lion.
    Whenever a lion participates in a hug for at least 30 seconds all at once, he or she will gain a temporary buff known as, "Hug Power".
    "Hug Power" gives the lion x2 movement speed and 1/2x stamina loss from running.
    When a lion herd is migrating, the lions will often engage in large group hugs so that all of them may gain "Hug Power".

<p>
    Monkeys lead very strange lives.
    Everyday, monkeys wake up at about 7am.
    They eat breakfast and fix themselves a coffee.
    Then, at about 8:30am, they get in their cars and commute to work.
    Most monkeys work in offices, but some work from home remotely, or are even self-employed.
    Monkeys seems to use a strange economical system known as, "capitalism".
    Under this system, a small fraction of the population own the vast majority of wealth, and the middle class must work at least 40 hours every week just to earn a livable wage.
    Additionally, the price of many different commidities is steadily rising, to the point that monkeys struggle to afford basic goods.

<p>
    Alligators are quite the jovial and mobile sort.
    Due to the rapidly fluctuating temperatures all over the globe, alligators are hard-pressed to find places that are consistantly comfortable.
    However, alligators are head-strong!
    Early in the morning, all alligators begin to migrate southward.
    Alligators will pick up others along the way, until they have sizeable herds.
    The largest reported alligators herds exceeds one million alligators!
    They spend all day migrating, until eventually, they all reach Antarctica.
    Convienently, Antarctica is a comfortable 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit all night, everynight.
    When the alligators are done migrating, they all chill out in Antarctica and spend all night having a disco rave party.
